# Crime Reports Analysis (January - August 2023)
This project is a comprehensive analysis of crime reports from January to August 2023.

## Project Overview
In this project, Iâ€™ve conducted data cleaning, enrichment, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the crime reports dataset. The cleaned and enriched data was then used to create an interactive dashboard on Tableau.

## Interactive Dashboard
Here is the link to the Tableau dashboard 
https://public.tableau.com/views/CrimenesenColombia/Dashboard22?:language=es-ES&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

The Tableau dashboard provides a detailed view of each crime. You can click on a specific crime and explore various aspects such as:

The frequency of the crime in different locations
The most commonly used weapons
The day of the week when the crime is most reported
The dashboard also provides demographic insights into the victims, breaking down the data by age group and gender.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized into two main folders: data and notebooks.

### Data Folder
The data folder contains two subfolders:

raw_data: This folder contains the raw data files.
processed_data: This folder contains the processed data files after cleaning and enrichment.

### Notebooks Folder
The notebooks folder contains all the Jupyter notebooks and scripts used for data cleaning, enrichment, and EDA:

01_Importing_and_cleaning_data.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook contains all the scripts used for data cleaning.
02_EDA.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook contains all the scripts used for EDA.
03_Enrichment.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook contains all the scripts used for data enrichment.
toolbox.py: This Python script contains several useful functions used in the notebooks.
Feel free to explore this repository and provide any feedback or insights. Happy exploring!
